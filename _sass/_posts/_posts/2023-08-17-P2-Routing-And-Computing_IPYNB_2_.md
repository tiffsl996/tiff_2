# Networking
a network is essentially a bunch of computer or internet devices that are connected with wires so they can communicate

This network, however, will take a long time to have A comunicate with G. So a network that will work faster is shown below. There are different benefits to each as well, the first one takes less resources, but if one of the wires breaks, the whole comunication fails. But wih the second one, it takes a lot of resources, but if one wire fails, the comunication will still work. This second network in this case is fault tolerent.

Is this network fault tolerent?

## Redundancy
The Internet is fault tolerant and has been made to withstand errors or problems that may occur. It does this by using redundancy. Redundancy is the inclusion of extra components in order to mitigate the failure of one part of the system. One method of to achieve this is having multiple paths between connected devices allowing transfers to have alternative routes. If a route fails the data will be sent down a different path. Fault tolerance allows users to use a network even if there are  system failures. One example where redundancy wasn't present was the backend during the night at the museum. The pathway to transfer data likely broke, and there was no redundancy to allow for an alternative path.
