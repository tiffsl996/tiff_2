# Lists + Binary Search

## List Operations 

- aList[i] - This access your list at index i. An index is a numeric value that represents the position of an element within that data structure. For example, the first element of aList is at index 1, represented by aList[1]. 
- x <- aList[i] - Assigns value of aList[i] to variable x
- aList[i] <- x - Assigns value of x to aList[i]
- aList[i] <- aList[j] - Assigns value of aList[j] to aList[i]
    
- INSERT(aList, i , value) - aList is the list in which you want to insert the value. i is the index at which you want to insert the value. value is the value you want to insert at that index
- APPEND(aList, value) - The value you put in is placed at the end of aList
- REMOVE(aList, i) - aList is the list in which you want to delete the value. i is the index at which you want to delete the value.
- LENGTH(aList) - Gives you the number of elements in aList

- FOR EACH item IN aList {
    blah blah blah
} - Item is a var assigned each element of aList in order from first element to last. The code inside the for loop is run once for every assignment of item. 


```python
1. 
FOR EACH item IN aList {  
    PRINT(item)  
}

This code iterates through each element (item) in the list aList and for each item, it prints the value of that item.


2. 
FOR i FROM 0 TO LENGTH(aList) {
    IF aList[i] == 42 THEN
        PRINT("Found 42 at index " + i)
}

This code iterates through each index from 0 to LENGTH(aList). For each index i, it checks if the value at that index in aList is equal to 42. 
If it finds 42 at any index, it prints a message indicating that it found 42 at that index.
```

## Comparing Python and College Board Pseudo Code


```python
Creating a List
Python: my_list = [1, 2, 3]
Pseudo Code: my_list ‚Üê [1, 2, 3]

Accessing Elements
Python: value = my_list[index]
Pseudo Code: value <- my_list[index]

Appending Elements
Python: my_list.append(new_value)
Pseudo Code: Append new_value to my_list

Inserting Elements
Python: my_list.insert(index, new_value)
Pseudo Code: Insert new_value at index in my_list

Removing Elements
Python: my_list.remove(value)
Pseudo Code: Remove value from my_list

Modifying Elements
Python: my_list[index] = new_value
Pseudo Code: my_list[index] <- new_value

Checking Length
Python: length = len(my_list)
Pseudo Code: length <- Length of my_list

Iterating through a List
Python: for item in my_list: 
{ <block of statement> }
Pseudo Code: For each item in my_list: 
{ <block of statement> }

Checking for Existence
Python: if value in my_list:
{ <block of statement> }
Pseudo Code: If value is in my_list: 
{ <block of statement> }

List Slicing
Python: sub_list = my_list[start:end]
Pseudo Code: sub_list <- my_list[start:end]
```

# Popcorn Hack
Add 5 to the list in between 4 and 6 in both python and pseudo code
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]

## More Pseudo Code and Python


```python
Psuedocode for Sum of Even Number List
Set sum to 0
For each score in the list nums:
    If (score MOD 2 = 0):
        Add score to sum
Display the value of sum as the sum of even numbers in the list

In Python:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_sum = 0
for score in nums:
    if score % 2 == 0: # Check if the remainder when divided by 2 is 0 (even number)
        even_sum += score # If previous requirement is fulfilled, add to sum
print("Sum of even numbers in the list:", even_sum)
```


```python
Minimum Value List:
def find_minimum_value(input_list):
    if len(input_list) == 0:
        return None  
    min_value = input_list[0]
    for num in input_list[1:]:
        if num < min_value:
            min_value = num  
    return min_value
my_list = [5, 2, 9, 1, 8, 3]
min_value = find_minimum_value(my_list)
print("Minimum value:", min_value)
```

## Binary Search

- Binary Search is a method of searching for an element in a list. <br>
- Binary Search is faster than Linear Search <br>
- How does Binary Search work?

- Worst Case Scenario: 4 Iterations <br> <br><br>



```python
arr = [2, 7, 12, 29, 33, 50, 59, 61, 68, 88, 91]
iterations = 0
def binary_search(arr, target, iterations):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        iterations += 1

        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Element found, return its index
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search the right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search the left half
target = 7
position = binary_search(arr, target, iterations)
print(f"The element {target} is at index {position}.")
print(f"Iterations: {iterations}")
```

### Big O Notation
- Big O notation is a way to measure the upper limit of a function's runtime.
- Common Big O Notations:
* O(1): Constant time (Ex. searching up an element by index)
* O(log n): As input size increases, time grows slowly (Binary Search!)
* O(n): Linear time: As input size increases, time grows proportionally. (Linear Search)
* O(2^n): Exponential time: Highly inefficient, as input size increases, time grows exponentially. (Brute force)
* O(n!): Factorial time: Extremely inefficient, often used to find all possible permutations of a problem.

### Homework
1) Write an expression that uses list indexing and list procedures. Write comments on your code to show what each line is doing. 
2) Write a python function that can determine the worst case number of iterations of a binary search for an array of length 20.


```python
3) You have a list `myList` containing the following elements: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50].

FOR i FROM 0 TO LENGTH(myList) {
    x <- myList[i]
    myList[i] <- x * 2
}

What will be the final content of `myList` after executing this algorithm?

A) [20, 40, 60, 80, 100]
B) [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
C) [10, 40, 30, 20, 50]
D) [50, 40, 30, 20, 10]
```
