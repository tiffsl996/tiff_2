# Team Teach: Legal and Ethical Concerns

There are many legal and ethical concerns in the digital world, as lots of things are widely accessable. Following rules like privacy and property laws is important for legal concerns. Not only that but treating people fairly, being honest in business, and taking care of the environment are also important (ethical concerns). It's necessary to obey rules and think about how actions affect everyone.

Intellectual Property: A work or invention that is the result of creativity to which one has rights i.e symbols, names, ideas you create

## How to Protect IP

Patents: grants inventors exclusive rights to their inventions for a limited time, requiring disclosure of details in exchange. The legal process involves applying, meeting patentability criteria, and potential enforcement through legal action against infringement.

Copyright: protects IP, given to all rights reserved copyright to creator of IP, prevents from using unless given permission

Plagiarism, the act of copying copyrighted material without permission, bears legal consequences.

DO NOT PLAGIARIZE

## Ethical Use of Copyright Material

Navigating the realm of copyright involves understanding legal avenues for utilizing intellectual property responsibly. Here are a few ethical paths:

### Creative Commons: A Symphony of Sharing
Creative Commons licenses provide a roadmap for using copyrighted material responsibly. The Attribution (BY), NonCommercial (SA), and ShareAlike (SA) licenses offer varying degrees of freedom while maintaining respect for the original creators.

- CCBY (Attribution): Allows others to copy, distribute, display, and perform the work and derivative works based upon it, but only if they give the author or licensor the credits in the manner specified.

- NonCommercial (SA): Allows for remixing, tweaking, and building upon the work even for commercial purposes, as long as the original creator is credited and the new creations are licensed under the identical terms.

- ShareAlike (SA): Permits others to copy, distribute, display, and perform the work and derivative works based upon it for non-commercial purposes only, with appropriate credit.


### Open Source: Fostering Collaboration
Open-source software, with licenses like GNU General Public License (GPL) and Apache License, promotes free access and modification. However, this openness brings challenges, as creations can be easily exploited.

### Open Access: Breaking Down Barriers
Open access in academia, with its lack of copyright restrictions, fosters a more inclusive and accessible landscape. Author retention of rights allows scholars to maintain control over their work.
