## What is intellectual property?

Intellectual property is a work or invention that is the result of creativity, to which one has rights over. 

In the modernized world today, intellectual property can be shared more easily now through the Internet. This raises concerns about who owns something that was created digitally. 


## Copyright

Copyright protects your IP and keeps anyone else from using it, unless they have permission. Anything you create like a picture u took or a digital drawing, you automatically own an “All rights reserved” copyright. If we pretend that material is our own then it becomes plagiarism 

There are ways to create material for others to use: 

Creative Commons
- Provides free licenses that you can use to tell others how you want them to use your creation
- Examples: If you draw a picture and you want other people to use and distribute it without asking for permission. If you have a song that you want to freely share 
- It clearly outlines whether certain people can use it for creative commons, whether it’s commercial or for another reason 

Open Source
- Are open for anyone to use and the IP can modified in whatever ways people want, thus encouraging open collaboration 
- Refers exclusively to software

Open Access 
- Online research output free of any restrictions (like copyright or licesnse restrictions) and free of use so people can use this however they wish
- Example: Open access databases with journals and research papers for others to reference and use

- Give an example of an open source software and explain why it is an open source. 

## Legal/Ethical Concerns

No matter how you use something, it’s still important to cite information and give credit where it belongs. There is so information at our fingertips and though open source programs may be created with good intentions, people will sometimes use these open sources and modify them to harm individuals or groups. 

There are legal concerns regarding computing devices that collect and analyze data by monitoring individual activity. Digital media downloads can sometimes include viruses and harmful programs

#### Digital Divide and Bias 

Some softwares may include algorithms with bias. The training data for the software might underrepresent certain groups or demographics. Lack of fairness in algorithmic decision-making can perpetuate societal inequalities.

The digital divide is the unequal distribution of access to technology Although the Internet provides all these resources for us to use, certain groups of people do not have the technology readily available for them to use. These databases and online resources are only beneficial to those who have the opportunities and privileges to understand and access technology.
