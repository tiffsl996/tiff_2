# Database Programming is Program with Data
> Each Tri's Final Project should be an example of a Program with Data. 

>  Prepare to use SQLite in common Imperative Technique
- Explore [SQLite Connect object](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_data_access/python_sqlite_establishing_connection.htm) to establish database connection
- Explore [SQLite Cursor Object](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_data_access/python_sqlite_cursor_object.htm) to fetch data from a table within a database


## Schema of Users table in Sqlite.db
> Uses PRAGMA statement to read schema.

Describe Schema, here is resource [Resource](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
- What is a database schema?
- What is the purpose of identity Column in SQL database?
- What is the purpose of a primary key in SQL database?
- What are the Data Types in SQL table?


```python
import sqlite3

database = 'instance/sqlite.db' # this is location of database

def schema():
    
    # Connect to the database file
    conn = sqlite3.connect(database)

    # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Fetch results of Schema
    results = cursor.execute("PRAGMA table_info('users')").fetchall()

    # Print the results
    for row in results:
        print(row)

    # Close the database connection
    conn.close()
    
schema()

```

## Reading Users table in Sqlite.db
> Uses SQL SELECT statement to read data

- What is a connection object?  After you google it, what do you think it does?
- Same for cursor object?
- Look at conn object and cursor object in VSCode debugger.  What attributes are in the object?
- Is "results" an object?  How do you know?


```python
import sqlite3

def read():
    # Connect to the database file
    conn = sqlite3.connect(database)

    # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Execute a SELECT statement to retrieve data from a table
    results = cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM users').fetchall()

    # Print the results
    if len(results) == 0:
        print("Table is empty")
    else:
        for row in results:
            print(row)

    # Close the cursor and connection objects
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
    
read()

```

## Create a new User in table in Sqlite.db
> Uses SQL INSERT to add row
-  Compore create() in both SQL lessons.  What is better or worse in the two implementations?
-  Explain purpose of SQL INSERT.   Is this the same as User __init__?


```python
import sqlite3

def create():
    name = input("Enter your name:")
    uid = input("Enter your user id:")
    password = input("Enter your password")
    dob = input("Enter your date of birth 'YYYY-MM-DD'")
    
    # Connect to the database file
    conn = sqlite3.connect(database)

    # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    try:
        # Execute an SQL command to insert data into a table
        cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (_name, _uid, _password, _dob) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)", (name, uid, password, dob))
        
        # Commit the changes to the database
        conn.commit()
        print(f"A new user record {uid} has been created")
                
    except sqlite3.Error as error:
        print("Error while executing the INSERT:", error)


    # Close the cursor and connection objects
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
    
#create()
```

## Updating a User in table in Sqlite.db
> Uses SQL UPDATE to modify password
- What does the hacked part do?
- Explain try/except, when would except occur?
- What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated?


```python
import sqlite3

def update():
    uid = input("Enter user id to update")
    password = input("Enter updated password")
    if len(password) < 2:
        message = "hacked"
        password = 'gothackednewpassword123'
    else:
        message = "successfully updated"

    # Connect to the database file
    conn = sqlite3.connect(database)

    # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    try:
        # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table
        cursor.execute("UPDATE users SET _password = ? WHERE _uid = ?", (password, uid))
        if cursor.rowcount == 0:
            # The uid was not found in the table
            print(f"No uid {uid} was not found in the table")
        else:
            print(f"The row with user id {uid} the password has been {message}")
            conn.commit()
    except sqlite3.Error as error:
        print("Error while executing the UPDATE:", error)
        
    
    # Close the cursor and connection objects
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
    
#update()

```

## Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db
> Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id.
- Is DELETE a dangerous operation?  Why?
- In the print statemements, what is the "f" and what does {uid} do?


```python
import sqlite3

def delete():
    uid = input("Enter user id to delete")

    # Connect to the database file
    conn = sqlite3.connect(database)

    # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    try:
        cursor.execute("DELETE FROM users WHERE _uid = ?", (uid,))
        if cursor.rowcount == 0:
            # The uid was not found in the table
            print(f"No uid {uid} was not found in the table")
        else:
            # The uid was found in the table and the row was deleted
            print(f"The row with uid {uid} was successfully deleted")
        conn.commit()
    except sqlite3.Error as error:
        print("Error while executing the DELETE:", error)
        
    # Close the cursor and connection objects
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
    
#delete()
```

# Menu Interface to CRUD operations
> CRUD and Schema interactions from one location by running menu. Observe input at the top of VSCode, observe output underneath code cell.
- Why does the menu repeat?
- Could you refactor this menu?  Make it work with a List?


```python
# Menu, to run other cells from one control point
def menu():
    operation = input("Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete or (S)chema")
    if operation.lower() == 'c':
        create()
    elif operation.lower() == 'r':
        read()
    elif operation.lower() == 'u':
        update()
    elif operation.lower() == 'd':
        delete()
    elif operation.lower() == 's':
        schema()
    elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key
        return
    else:
        print("Please enter c, r, u, or d") 
    menu() # recursion, repeat menu
        
try:
    menu() # start menu
except:
    print("Perform Jupyter 'Run All' prior to starting menu")

```

# Hacks
- Add this Blog to you own Blogging site.  In the Blog add notes and observations on each code cell.
- In this implementation, do you see procedural abstraction?
- In 2.4a or 2.4b lecture
    - Do you see data abstraction?  Complement this with Debugging example.
    - Use Imperative or OOP style to Create a new Table or do something that applies to your CPT project.
