## Database and SQLAlchemy

This lesson is to help you build your database for your group passion project and set up a data table to store the log-in information of your users. 

Databases, Iterative/OOP
- Iterative: Refers to a sequence of instructions or code being repeated until a specific end result is achieved
- OOP: A computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic
- SQL: Structured Query Language, abbreviated as SQL, is a language used in programming, managing, and structuring data

**In order to build your log-in system using the following code, you will need to first download an extension: "sqlite viewer"**

### Imports and Flask Objects

- definitions and key object creations

This is how you set up your Flask server and create a database to connect to your backend repository. You should follow the code below step by step. This will create the Flask app object and the actual database object. 

Mr. Lopez might want you to put this code in a specific area on your backend.


```python
"""
These imports define the key objects
"""

from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

"""
These object and definitions are used throughout the Jupyter Notebook.
"""

# Setup of key Flask object (app)
app = Flask(__name__)
# Setup SQLAlchemy object and properties for the database (db)
database = 'sqlite:///sqlite.db'  # path and filename of database
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = database
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'SECRET_KEY'
db = SQLAlchemy()


# This belongs in place where it runs once per project
db.init_app(app)
```

### Model Definition

- Define columns, initialization, and CRUD methods for users table in sqlite.db

This is the model code, or the actual code that will initialize your data table and assign properties to your columns. This table will store the data users input when building thier log-ins to your site. 


```python
""" database dependencies to support sqlite examples """
import datetime
from datetime import datetime
import json

from sqlalchemy.exc import IntegrityError
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash


''' Tutorial: https://www.sqlalchemy.org/library.html#tutorials, try to get into a Python shell and follow along '''

# Define the User class to manage actions in the 'users' table
# -- Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is the key concept of SQLAlchemy
# -- a.) db.Model is like an inner layer of the onion in ORM
# -- b.) User represents data we want to store, something that is built on db.Model
# -- c.) SQLAlchemy ORM is layer on top of SQLAlchemy Core, then SQLAlchemy engine, SQL
class User(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'users'  # table name is plural, class name is singular

    # Define the User schema with "vars" from object
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    _name = db.Column(db.String(255), unique=False, nullable=False)
    _uid = db.Column(db.String(255), unique=True, nullable=False)
    _password = db.Column(db.String(255), unique=False, nullable=False)
    _dob = db.Column(db.Date)

```

### Initial Data 

- Uses SQLALchemy db.create_all() to initialize rows into sqlite.db

This is for when you start running your flask server. It creates initial data in your database for testing. 


```python
"""Database Creation and Testing """


# Builds working data for testing
def initUsers():
    with app.app_context():
        """Create database and tables"""
        db.create_all()
        """Tester data for table"""
        u1 = User(name='Thomas Edison', uid='toby', password='123toby', dob=datetime(1847, 2, 11))
        u2 = User(name='Nikola Tesla', uid='niko', password='123niko')
        u3 = User(name='Alexander Graham Bell', uid='lex', password='123lex')
        u4 = User(name='Eli Whitney', uid='whit', password='123whit')
        u5 = User(name='Indiana Jones', uid='indi', dob=datetime(1920, 10, 21))
        u6 = User(name='Marion Ravenwood', uid='raven', dob=datetime(1921, 10, 21))


        users = [u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, u6]

        """Builds sample user/note(s) data"""
        for user in users:
            try:
                '''add user to table'''
                object = user.create()
                print(f"Created new uid {object.uid}")
            except:  # error raised if object nit created
                '''fails with bad or duplicate data'''
                print(f"Records exist uid {user.uid}, or error.")
                
initUsers()
```

### Check for given Credentials in users table in sqlite.db

- Use of ORM Query object and custom methods to identify user to credentials uid and password

This code allows you to search through your database to find individual users. This can be used to check if the username and password matches what the user inputted in the database. 

The first block of code uses SQRAlchemy's ORM capabilities to filter and retrieve a user based on their UID. The UID serves as the primary key for the 'users' table in the database.

The second block of code is focused on user authentication. It first checks if a user matching the given UID exists, then verifies if the password entered matches the stored password for that user. 

"sqlite.db" is the name of your file


```python
# SQLAlchemy extracts single user from database matching User ID
def find_by_uid(uid):
    with app.app_context():
        user = User.query.filter_by(_uid=uid).first()
    return user # returns user object

# Check credentials by finding user and verify password
def check_credentials(uid, password):
    # query email and return user record
    user = find_by_uid(uid)
    if user == None:
        return False
    if (user.is_password(password)):
        return True
    return False
        
#check_credentials("indi", "123qwerty")
```

### Create a new User in table in Sqlite.db

- Uses SQLALchemy and custom user.create() method to add row.

This is to allow a user to register an account on your site and make it so that their information goes straight to your data table when they do so. 


```python
# Inputs, Try/Except, and SQLAlchemy work together to build a valid database object
def create():
    # optimize user time to see if uid exists
    uid = input("Enter your user id:")
    user = find_by_uid(uid)
    try:
        print("Found\n", user.read())
        return
    except:
        pass # keep going
    
    # request value that ensure creating valid object
    name = input("Enter your name:")
    password = input("Enter your password")
    
    # Initialize User object before date
    user = User(name=name, 
                uid=uid, 
                password=password
                )
    
    # create user.dob, fail with today as dob
    dob = input("Enter your date of birth 'YYYY-MM-DD'")
    try:
        user.dob = datetime.strptime(dob, '%Y-%m-%d').date()
    except ValueError:
        user.dob = datetime.today()
        print(f"Invalid date {dob} require YYYY-mm-dd, date defaulted to {user.dob}")
           
    # write object to database
    with app.app_context():
        try:
            object = user.create()
            print("Created\n", object.read())
        except:  # error raised if object not created
            print("Unknown error uid {uid}")
        
create()
```

### Reading users table in sqlite.db

- Uses SQLALchemy query.all method to read data

This allows the computer to read all the data in your data table at once. You could use this function if you needed to print out all your data information, for example. It is also more efficient to upload all your data from the backend to frontend at once versus uploading each user's information individually, and this function allows you to do that.



```python
# SQLAlchemy extracts all users from database, turns each user into JSON
def read():
    with app.app_context():
        table = User.query.all()
    json_ready = [user.read() for user in table] # "List Comprehensions", for each user add user.read() to list
    return json_ready

read()
```

IMPORTANT NOTE: Note, as people look for Python databases on the web they will often run into imperative style implementation versus OOP style. This is provided for reference, but it is not recommended as the primary implementation for this class.
