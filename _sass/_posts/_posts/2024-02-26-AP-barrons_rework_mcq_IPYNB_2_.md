##  Extend Book Class
> Consider inheritance hierarchy, in which Novel and Textbook are subclasses of Book

```
          ---------------
          |    Book     |
          ---------------
           ^          ^
          /            \
         /              \
---------------        ---------------
|    Novel    |        |  TextBook   |
---------------        ---------------
```


## Perform these actions, answer questions, adjust code.

### class Book (Part 1)  Close Book Test
1. Define 1 argument constructor using title
2. Define toString method for id and title
3. Generate unique id for each object
4. Create a public getter that has Book Count
5. Define tester method that initializes at least 2 books, outputs id and title, and provides a count of books in library.

### extended Classes (Part 2) Try to use alternate forms of loops and techniques for construction.
1. Ensure Novel and Textbook run the Constructor from Book.
2. Create instance variables unique to Novel has Author, Textbook has publishing company.  New items are not required by Constructor.  
3. Make Getters and Setters for all new items.  For instance, be able to set items not required by constructor.
4. Add a time when book entered the library.  This should be same for Parent and Subclasses.  
5. Define tester method to test all items.

### Simulation (Part 3)
1. Build a Tester Method that does a Simulation.
2. Define a default method in Book that returns "current shelfLife" from date/time of construction. (Hint, think about capturing time in sorts)
3. Define shelfLife expiration methods as needed in TextBook and Novel. 
    - A TextBook has a fixed shelf life based on the date/time of constructor.  (Hint, simulation 3 yrs as 3000 milliseconds)
    - A Novel has a computed shelf life of expiration, the simulation should extend shelf life if a certain number of return stamps where placed in the book.  (Hint, 3 return stamps renews for an extra year)
4. Use a sleep in Java to assist with simulation
5. Make a method that determines if book has shelf life remaining, try to have title and on/off status in output.

    // Static attributes are called "Class Variables", the are not part of the Object
