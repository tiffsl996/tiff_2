## Introduction to Pandas and ML
> Here is how Mort started on this assignment by asking ChatGPT  ... Regarding Python Pandas, what are some data sets that would be good for learning Pandas?

- There are many data sets that are suitable for learning pandas, depending on your interests and the skills you want to develop. 

    Here are some suggestions...

    - Titanic Dataset: This is a classic dataset for data analysis and machine learning, and is often used as an introduction to pandas. The dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including their demographics, ticket class, and survival status.

    - Iris Dataset: This is another classic dataset that is often used in machine learning and data analysis courses. The dataset contains information about iris flowers, including their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

    - NBA Player Stats: This dataset contains information about NBA players, including their stats for various games, their positions, and their salaries. It is a great dataset for learning how to clean and manipulate data using pandas.

    - Housing Prices Dataset: This dataset contains information about housing prices in a particular city or region, including variables such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and price. It is a great dataset for learning how to manipulate and analyze numerical data using pandas.

    - COVID-19 Dataset: This dataset contains information about the COVID-19 pandemic, including the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries in various countries and regions. It is a great dataset for learning how to manipulate and analyze time-series data using pandas.

    - World Bank Dataset: This dataset contains information about economic indicators from various countries, such as GDP, population, and poverty rates. It is a great dataset for learning how to manipulate and analyze large datasets using pandas.


- These are just a few examples of the many datasets that are suitable for learning pandas. The best dataset for you will depend on your interests and the specific skills you want to develop.


> Follow up question, "where can I find Titanic data set?"

- The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning, and it can be found on various websites and data repositories. Here are a few places where you can find the Titanic dataset...

### Clean Titanic Data
This is called 'Cleaning' data.  

Most analysis, like Machine Learning require data to be in standardized format...
- All data needs to be numeric
- Some data is removed, as it is not useable in study
- Sex and alone is changed to binary 
- The embark data is split into multiple columns



```python
import pandas as pd
# Preprocess the data
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

td = titanic_data
td.drop(['alive', 'who', 'adult_male', 'class', 'embark_town', 'deck'], axis=1, inplace=True)
td.dropna(inplace=True) # drop rows with at least one missing value, after dropping unuseful columns
td['sex'] = td['sex'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 'male' else 0)
td['alone'] = td['alone'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == True else 0)

# Encode categorical variables
enc = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')
enc.fit(td[['embarked']])
onehot = enc.transform(td[['embarked']]).toarray()
cols = ['embarked_' + val for val in enc.categories_[0]]
td[cols] = pd.DataFrame(onehot)
td.drop(['embarked'], axis=1, inplace=True)
td.dropna(inplace=True) # drop rows with at least one missing value, after preparing the data

print(td.columns)
display(td)
```

    Index(['survived', 'pclass', 'sex', 'age', 'sibsp', 'parch', 'fare', 'alone',
           'embarked_C', 'embarked_Q', 'embarked_S'],

## Machine Learning <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scikit_learn/scikit_learn_introduction.htm#:~:text=Scikit%2Dlearn%20(Sklearn)%20is,a%20consistence%20interface%20in%20Python">Visit Tutorials Point</a>
> Scikit-learn (SciPy Toolkit) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.

- Description from ChatGPT...  The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. 

- In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training.
  - After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn't seen before.
  - For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct.
  - Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others.

- Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy.  
    - [Decision Trees](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree), prediction by a piecewise constant approximation.
    
    - [Logistic Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#logistic-regression), the probabilities describing the possible outcomes.


```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Split arrays or matrices into random train and test subsets.
X = td.drop('survived', axis=1)
y = td['survived']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train a decision tree classifier
dt = DecisionTreeClassifier()
dt.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Test the model
y_pred = dt.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print('DecisionTreeClassifier Accuracy: {:.2%}'.format(accuracy))  

# Train a logistic regression model
logreg = LogisticRegression()
logreg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Test the model
y_pred = logreg.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print('LogisticRegression Accuracy: {:.2%}'.format(accuracy))  
```

    DecisionTreeClassifier Accuracy: 74.71%
    LogisticRegression Accuracy: 78.82%

### Predicting Survival
The better prediction model appears to be logistic regression.  So, now we are ready to play the game... "Would I have survived the Titanic?".  

Insert your own data in the code.  Look at your analysis and consider how you would travel today.

    - pclass - Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
    - name - Name
    - sex - male or female
    - age - number of year 
    - sibsp - number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard
    - parch - number of Parents/Children Aboard
    - fare - passenger fare 0 to 512
    - embarked - Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
    - alone - boolean True or False


```python
import numpy as np

# Define a new passenger

    'age': [64],
    'sibsp': [1], # I usually travel with my wife
    'parch': [1], # currenly I have 1 child at home
    'fare': [16.00], # median fare picked assuming it is 2nd class
    'embarked': ['S'], # majority of passengers embarked in Southampton
    'alone': [False] # travelling with family (spouse and child))
})
